	<h4>A Message about the Ice</h4>
	
	
		<p>It&#8217;s winter, and that means ICE. Water&#8217;s deceivingly treacherous alter-ego has returned to knock you on you flat on your tuchise in so little as a single step. My point? BE CAREFUL ON THE ICE. 
			</p></br>
		<p>This ice (like all other ice) is icy ice that is ICY and you WILL fall and cause irreparable damage if you aren&#8217;t careful. Get out your galoshes and buy yourself a sturdy pair of ice cleats at Bergman&#8217;s 20% off sale this week only. Do not, however, think that these precautions are enough for you to let your guard down on the ice. The morning you start to strut in your cleats is the morning you end up with a concussion and a knee that only bends backwards. I have seen it before. 
			</p></br>
		<p>So, if you only remember one thing this winter, remember that there is ice outside and icy ice is slippery, SO BE CAREFUL ON THE SLIPPERY ICE. I will be offering hourly e-mail reminders for those who need a little kick in the butt. I am also forming a Neighborhood Coalition for the Safety of Children and Dogs on Ice (NCSCDI). Contact me if you’re interested.
		</p></br>
		<p>UPDATE: it has gotten icier out there since I last posted so please please please BE CAREFUL ON THE EVEN ICIER ICE

	<h4>Food Etiquette for the Gracious Host</h4>
			
	
				<p>If you are hosting anyone, even if they&#8217;re just stopping by on the way to an appointment, the proper thing to do, of course, is offer them a nosh. 
				</p></br>
				<p>Are they hungry? Ask. They say they are quite full, just ate lunch. But you are wiser than that—you know they&#8217;re just being polite. Are you sure? You ask. Besides, you don&#8217;t have to be hungry to eat homemade guac and chips. They don&#8217;t eat avocados? Good thing you have salsa and queso too! 
				</p></br>
			
			
		
				<p>Once they finally feel comfortable enough to except your offer, you have them sit down and relax, take a load off. You bring them the chips, queso, salsa, AND guacamole (just in case they change their mind). But is that all you bring? No. You just bought some succulent grapes this morning, and last night&#8217;s mashed potato casserole stares you down from its Tupperware cocoon. 
				</p></br>
				<p>	When you bring everything out, your guest gasps and says you shouldn&#8217;t have, and you&#8217;re consequently glad you did. Is there anything else you can get them? Certainly not. But they must be thirsty? You have apple cider and milk awaiting. Just water, they say, and you run the water until it&#8217;s cold. Ice? They&#8217;re fine without it, but you plop a couple cubes in anyway. 
				</p></br>
				<p>	Now, oh no! They&#8217;re on the verge of being late for their appointment and they&#8217;ve hardly touched the food. You rush to the rescue with baggies and plastic containers to package the food to go. Salsa in a bag looks less appealing than you thought it would, but it’s too late to turn back now. 
				</p></br>
				<p>	The whole time, your guest pleads with you to stop. It&#8217;s really not necessary, they say, but all you hear is the grumbling stomach they&#8217;re going to have in an hour.  
				</p></br>
				<p>After you give them a big hug goodbye, they rush out the door, thanking you all the way.  	&#34;Come back soon,&#34; you say,  &#34;come hungry!&#34;
				</p></br>
				</br><p>
				 	&#34;AND CAREFUL ON THE ICE.&#34;
